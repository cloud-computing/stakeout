Stakeout
----

A fantastically simple, one-page dashboard for SaaS availability checks. Supports HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP Ping, and automatic screenshots. (For the screenshot feature to work, you'll need PhantomJS installed! http://phantomjs.org/) Stakeout is a Ruby on Rails application utilizing jQuery and Bootstrap.

Todo
----

* Client-side JavaScript needs to be refactored to be asynchronous to not show the "Be cool!" dialog.
* Server should probably automatically capture screenshots at periodic intervals.. maybe?
